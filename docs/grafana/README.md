Grafana is a widely-used open-source platform for **monitoring**, **visualizing**, and **analyzing metrics** collected from various [[data source](data-sources.md)s](data-sources.md). It provides intuitive [dashboards](dashboards.md) and graphs to help users make sense of their data in real time.

## What is Grafana?

Grafana is a data visualization and monitoring tool that supports multiple types of [[data source](data-sources.md)s](data-sources.md), including:

- Time-series databases (e.g., **Prometheus**, **InfluxDB**).
- Relational databases (e.g., **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**).
- Cloud-based services (e.g., **AWS CloudWatch**, **Google Cloud Monitoring**).

With Grafana, users can create dynamic and customizable [dashboards](dashboards.md), define alerts, and explore data interactively. It is used in fields like DevOps, application monitoring, IoT, and business intelligence.

## Why Use Grafana?

Grafana provides several advantages that make it a popular choice for organizations and individuals:

### 1. **Unified Monitoring**  

   Grafana aggregates data from diverse sources into one place, offering a single-pane-of-glass view of systems and applications.

### 2. **Customizable Dashboards**  

   Users can create highly tailored [dashboards](dashboards.md) using a variety of panel types (graphs, heatmaps, gauges, tables, etc.).

### 3. **Alerting**  

   Grafana enables proactive monitoring by setting up **alerts** based on thresholds, notifying teams via email, Slack, PagerDuty, or other channels.

### 4. **Open Source and Extensible**  

   As an open-source tool, Grafana has a large community, frequent updates, and extensive support for plugins to extend its functionality.

### 5. **Ease of Integration**  

   Grafana integrates seamlessly with tools like **Prometheus**, **Elasticsearch**, **Graphite**, and other [[data source](data-sources.md)s](data-sources.md).

## How Grafana Works

Grafana's architecture consists of several key components:

### 1. **Data Sources**  

   Grafana connects to external [[data source](data-sources.md)s](data-sources.md) (e.g., databases, APIs, cloud services) to fetch metrics or logs. These [[data source](data-sources.md)s](data-sources.md) are configured in Grafana and accessed via queries.

### 2. **Dashboards and Panels**  

- **Dashboards**: Collections of panels organized for a specific purpose (e.g., monitoring server health).
- **Panels**: Individual visualizations within a dashboard, such as graphs, tables, or pie charts.

   Users write queries in data-source-specific languages (e.g., PromQL for Prometheus) to populate panels.

### 3. **Templating**  

   Templating allows users to create dynamic and reusable [dashboards](dashboards.md) by adding variables (e.g., filtering based on specific hosts or applications).

### 4. **Alerting System**  

- Alerts are configured on panels based on defined thresholds.
- Grafana can send notifications to a variety of channels when these conditions are met.

### 5. **Plugins and Extensions**  

   Grafana supports plugins to extend its capabilities, such as custom panels, [[data source](data-sources.md)s](data-sources.md), and app integrations.

### 6. **User Management and Authentication**  

   Grafana provides built-in support for user authentication and role-based access control, integrating with SSO, LDAP, and OAuth systems.

## Grafana Workflow

1. **Connect Data Sources**  
   Configure one or more [[data source](data-sources.md)s](data-sources.md) in Grafana.

2. **Query Data**  
   Use the query builder or raw query language to retrieve data from sources.

3. **Build Dashboards**  
   Create [dashboards](dashboards.md) by adding and customizing panels with visualizations.

4. **Define Alerts**  
   Set up alerts on specific panels to notify teams of critical changes or issues.

5. **Monitor and Analyze**  
   Continuously monitor [dashboards](dashboards.md) and logs, interact with data, and analyze performance trends.

---

## Example Use Cases

1. **Server and Application Monitoring**  
   Visualize CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, and network latency.

2. **Business Metrics**  
   Track sales, customer engagement, or operational KPIs using real-time data.

3. **IoT Monitoring**  
   Analyze sensor data or device performance metrics for connected systems.

4. **Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring**  
   Monitor cloud resources, costs, and utilization.

---

## Getting Started with Grafana

1. Install Grafana via [Docker](provisionig-docker.md), package managers, or [from source](provisioning-binaries.md).  
2. Access Grafana on its web UI (default port is `3000`).  
3. Add a [data source](data-sources.md) and explore the interface to start building [dashboards](dashboards.md).
